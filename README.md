This is where we will construct our own 3D Printer.

We can keep eachother updated in this readme file. 

In the overview file I will try to write up all the necessary knowledge that we need and get you up to speed.

PLAN OF ACTION:

[done]		Choose 3D printer type

[done]		Choose dimensions, precision

[done]		Choose necessary electronics and parts

[done]		Design x carrage and extruder mount

[done]		Design z carrage

[1/2]		Design printing bed

[done]		Design y carrage

[1/2]		Design frame

[]		Bills of materials

[]		Programming


** I am using freecad for the 3d modeling software on ubuntu, it is primitive but free

***How to add to github using terminal
