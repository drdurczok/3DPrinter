This is where we will construct our own 3D Printer.

We can keep eachother updated in this readme file. 

Most of my 3D models are at home, so I will update those later. For now I only 
uploaded some simple ideas I had for the printing bed(far from complete). 

In the overview file I will try to write up all the necessary knowledge that we need
and get you up to speed.

PLAN OF ACTION:
[done]		Choose 3D printer type
[done]		Choose dimensions, precision
[done]		Choose necessary electronics and parts
[done]		Design x carrage and extruder mount
[1/2]		Design z carrage
[]			Design printing bed
[]			Design y carrage
[]			Design frame
[]			Bills of materials
[]			Programming


** I am using freecad for the 3d modeling software on ubuntu, it is primitive but free

***How to add to github using terminal

git add yourfile		//use * for all
git commit -m "your comment"
git remote add origin https://github.com/drdurczok/3DPrinter.git			//this can be omitted later
git push




 Cheers  :)
